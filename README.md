# Step 2 set up your handy dandy config.

- Usually its good practice to give you more work before evaluating my code 
   blame it on the git ignore best practices :D Sorry . 

# STEP 3 Running the server 

 - It's Time to fire that server up and start testing that API.
  So make sure your in the correct directory  and run npm run server or the yarn equivalent.
  I have you covered with nodemon keeps the carpal tunnel down. 

-Once you have things up and running  use  Postman or your favorite API testing tool and evaluate

# LightFeatherChallenge2020 Question #2

# step 1 Navigate  to the correct directory and npm/yarn install the dependencies

- cd  lightfeather\LightFeatherChallenge2020\client\questiontwo


# step 2 Running Question two setup ( this project is boot strapped with react Obviously)

- run npm run start or equivalent and start the evaluation process.
  

   side note usually I use a package called concurrently that allows for a more of robust approached of running both client and server in one yarn or NPM
